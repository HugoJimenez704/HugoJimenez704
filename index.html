        <h1>What I'm up to</h1>
        <p>My name is Hugo Jimenez. I'm an electronics technician student and I made 
            this website to do the thing I <em>love</em> the most, talk about myself.</p>
        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <p>Let's get straight to business, this is what I'm working on or have worked on for school or for myself:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">

                <th>Self-Driving Cart</th>
                <th>Simon Says Alarm Clock</th>
                <th>Fire Emblem in C</th>

              <tr>
                <td>A self driving cart that uses distance sensors to nearby objects, and turns around to not crash.
                    like a Roomba.
                </td>
                <td>An alarm clock that ensures you're fully woken up by forcing you to play a Simon says game 
                    in order to stop the alarm.

                <td>An attempt at making a game engine to develop Fire Emblem like games in C.</td>
