        <h1>What I'm up to</h1>
        <p>My name is Hugo Jimenez. I'm an electronics technician student and I made 
            this website to do the thing I <em>love</em> the most, talk about myself.</p>
        <h2>My projects</h2>
        <p>Let's get straight to business, this is what I'm working on or have worked on for school or for myself:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <tr>
                <th>Self-Driving Cart</th>
                <th>Simon Says Alarm Clock</th>
                <th>Fire Emblem in C</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Tech used: Embedded C, Ultrasonic Sensors, Motors</td>
                <td>Arduino, Basic electronic I/O, SolidWorks</td>
                <td>C</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>A self driving cart that uses distance sensors to nearby objects, and turns around to not crash.
                    like a Roomba.
                </td>
                <td>An alarm clock that ensures you're fully woken up by forcing you to play a Simon says game 
                    in order to stop the alarm.
                </td>
                <td>An attempt at making a game engine to develop Fire Emblem like games in C.</td>

            <dd>I've love videogames ever since I was a kid. From shooters like CoD MW3 to real-time strategy games like Age of Empires.
                I love playing videogames and messing around with consoles. Lately, I have grown more and more interested 
                in the homebrew and modding scene, due to how close those programs get to the hardware.

            <dt>Music</dt>
            <dd>I play the piano and the bass, mostly by myself but I jam with my dad and my brother every once in a while.</dd>
            <dt>Reading</dt>
            <dd>I've always been a reader, and after not reading much since the pandemic I've got back into the habit for the last year.
                I'm currently reading Think, by Simon Blackburn.
